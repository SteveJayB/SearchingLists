This project is a Python file that uses multiple different functions to search manually input lists. Also included are functions to edit the lists in a few different ways. Once the file is run, the Terminal will display a result of four different tests that were run. The first test searchs the list for seven different numbers. If the number is found, it will output its position in the list. If not, it will output -1. 

Next, the second test searches a hash list instead of a regular one. The hash list is created in its own class with multiple functions. Once new numbers are added to the hash list with the defined put function, the list uses another function to search for a few numbers and outputs True if it is in the list, and False if it is not.

The third test works around a hash table and another data variable. There is a class that creates the hash table similar to the list above. Once the table is created, two strings are added to each value, one for name and one for age. One last get function is used to display the age of the person that signified within the code.

The last test takes a list of 15 digits and sorts them in order as the output. This is done as each number in the list searches the other numbers included. The number searching will stop itself once it comes across a larger number and then will place itself in that current place in the list.
